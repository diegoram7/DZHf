Lu-Hf isotopic data

sampleid    = Sample name 
spot_number = Analysis number
176Lu_177Hf = Measured 176Lu/177Hf ratio
1s_error    = Analytical uncertainty of the 176Lu/177Hf ratio (1σ)	
176Hf_177Hf = Measured 176Hf/177Hf ratio
1s_error.1  = Analytical uncertainty of the 176Hf/177Hf ratio (1σ)
t(Ga)       = Calculated age in Ga
2s_error    = Analytical uncertainty of the t(Ga) age (2σ) (Not mandatory)
